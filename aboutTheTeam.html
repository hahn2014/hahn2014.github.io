                        </h2>
                        <p>Bryce Hahn is a High School senior currently finishing his last semester at Sunset High School. He has taken all provided programming classes including but not limited to: Java, C++, HTML/CSS/Javascript and GML. His post High School goal is to go to college to study Computer Science and Software Engeneering. He plans to double major in 5 years and secure a job developing software post university. Bryce Hahn is the main game developer for Mift. He began programming Mift in June of 2015 as an attempt to show his teacher, <a href="#about-jason-galbraith">Jason Galbraith</a>, his programming potential. Over the span of the following summer, and all of his senior year, Bryce continued to develop Mift at his own pace, introducing new features every so often.</p>
